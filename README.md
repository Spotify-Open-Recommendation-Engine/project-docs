# Spotify Open Recommendation Engine | Project Docs

The purpose of this repo is to house all project documentation (for CSE 115A) in one public place.

## What's here:
A few PDF docs in a few directories:

### `release1/`
  - **Release plan** - overview & initial user stories (this was our first project doc, ever!)
  - **Known problems report** - list of known problems within the app on release

### `sprint1/` ~ `sprint4/`
  - **Sprint plan** - constructed at the beginning of each 2-week sprint
  - **Sprint review** - assembled at the end of each sprint

Enjoy!
